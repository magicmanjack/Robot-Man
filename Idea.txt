Bad people try to get into the city by hiding on the vehicles coming into the city. The robot man must detect them fast
and stomp em' dead. Stomping the innocent will result in cutting off vital supplies into the city.

Textures are shown as 4* the original size in the 600x600 square window. 

Dimensions of cells is equal to 60 * 0.9^n :

--------
n = 4
--------
n = 3
--------

n = 2

--------

n = 1

--------

n = 0

--------

The Y coordinate of any cell:

	int yPos = 600;
	for(int i = 0; i < numCells; i++) {
		yPos -= (60 * std::pow(0.9, i));
		cellAt(i).yPos = yPos; // unless viewed from the opposite direction which would be cellAt((numCells-1) - i)
	}
	//this position should be stored instead of recalculated every render cycle.
